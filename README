# Note, this is my enhanced copy of the CRAN 'bigmemory' package.

All rights go to the original authors.  My goal herein has been to add
functionality that I believed to be valuable.  This copy comes with no
warranty and is likely to be somewhat buggy between updates.

Additions
1. 'resize' function for SharedMatix objects
This facilitates reshapeing big.matrix objects.  Optionally, new
columns may be added.  Currently unable to add rows without values
reassigning positions.

# These first notes document changes to the BOOST includes required
# for the Bigmemory Project.

1. Removed boost/interprocess/containers/detail since it was empty.
2. os_file_functions.hpp: Changed line 125 from

  if(size > filesize){

  to 

  if(size > static_cast<std::size_t>(filesize)){

  to get rid of the compiler warning.

3. seed_rng.hpp: Changed line 150 from

  std::fread( buffer, 1, 20, random_ );
 
  to 

  size_t temp = std::fread( buffer, 1, 20, random_ );

# These second notes document a change required to get Sun Studio 12.1
# working with C++.

# See http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5393796,
# the comment by liboqun on Dec 10, 2009.  We followed the
# instructions, replacing the 12.1 version of cdefs.h with
# the recommended version from Sun Studio 12, resolving the
# problem (errors relating to stdio.h).
